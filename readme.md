# Handcrafted Ecommerce Website
This is a handcrafted ecommerce website that being made entirely from scratch witout popular frond-end frameworks (like React) and the helps of Ai tools. It's purely done by html, css, javascript including some useful css libraries and js packages.

This project is a part of my learning process, and I want to make it scaleable and maintainable along with my learning journey. It should be able to integrate multiple components and external services as easya as possible.
